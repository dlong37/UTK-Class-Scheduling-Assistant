### What you planned to do
* Design a UI for the main schedule page [#22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/22)
* Improve the flash messages for the login/register pages [#23](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/23)
* Add frontend to the schedule page [#28](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/28)

### What you did not do
> I did not get as much done with the UI of the main page as I would have liked, and the animations when loading the schedule questionnaire did not turn out as well as I had envisioned.

### What problems you encountered
> I had problems working with flask flash messages when displaying alerts to users trying to log in. The messages display as intended, but they do not dismiss automatically.

### Issues you worked on

### What you accomplished
> I was able to successfully design the frontend for our main page as well as our schedule questionnaire page that matches the overall theme of our web application. These pages feature the same smooth fade-in animations as the login/register pages. The questionnaire page specifically features attractive dropdown boxes so users can see exactly where to put their information. I was also able to connect these new pages with the flask web application so that user schedule information can be recalled when logging in.
