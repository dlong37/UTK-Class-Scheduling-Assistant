## Product Description
The UTK Class Scheduling Assistant (CSA) simplifies the stressful class scheduling process by automatically generating a personalized schedule based on a student's degree path. It takes into account core coursework, time conflicts, credit hours, electives, and factors like class location and preferred class timings. It creates efficient schedules with classes close to each other if the user specifies location based generation. If the user specifies time based generation it allows students to customize start times and breaks between classes.
