# Sprint 1 Reflection

**GitHubID:** dlong37 <br>
**Group Name:** UTK Class Scheduling Assistant

## What I Planned To Do
* Create a welcome page for the user
* Implement mobile responsiveness for the welcome page
* Create a navigational bar to quickly access links in our website
* Linking the welcome page with the login page.

## What I Didn't Do
* Add more images to the welcome page.
* Add nice animations to the welcome page.

## Problems I Encountered
I had problems when it came to designing the website through CSS, mainly figuring out how to make the links and the logo of our product look nice on our website. I also took a while to implement mobile responsiveness for the website and figure out how to still make it clean when the window was smaller.

## Issues I Worked On
* [#1](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/1): Fix frontend for home, login, register.
* [#2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/5): Develop frontend for the main page.

## Files I Worked On
#### Designing the Welcome Page on Frontend

* UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/sprint1/frontend/welcome/styles.css
* UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/sprint1/frontend/welcome/app.js

## What I Accomplished
I was able to accomplish producing an aesthetically pleasing welcome page for the user to first see when they access our website, along with incorporating some functionality with buttons to direct users to different pages in our website.
