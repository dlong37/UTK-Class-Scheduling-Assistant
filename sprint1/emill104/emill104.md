### What you planned to do
* Create a login and register page for the user [#3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/3)
* Design a UTK themed website style [#1](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/1)
* Begin designing a UI for the schedule page [#5](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/5)

### What you did not do
* Begin designing a UI for the schedule page
* Make animations more advanced
* Make flask flash messages more obvious

### What problems you encountered
> I had problems figuring out how to integrate the frontend html/css/js files with the flask project directories because I was not familiar with using this framework.

### Issues you worked on
* [#1](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/1) Fix frontend for home, login, register
* [#3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/3) Allow users to register and log in
* [#5](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/issues/5) Develop frontend for the main page

### Files you worked on
##### Designing frontend:

##### Integrating with backend:

* UTK-Class-Scheduling-Assistant/sprint1/backend/templates/register.html

### What you accomplished
> I was successfully able to design the frontend for a login and register page so that users of our web application will be able to have a seemless experience logging in/creating an account. These pages feature smooth fade-in animations with attractive input boxes and submit buttons so that users know exactly where to enter their information. I was also able to integrate the frontend design with the flask user database so that users' information is stored and recalled when needed.
