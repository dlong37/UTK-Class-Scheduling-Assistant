### Reading in from major_courses.csv ###

This program reads in from major_courses.csv, which is our "database" file with all of the major courses required for a CS degree from UTK.
We will update and use this course file to make a program that can schedule your classes for you!
It includes the course abbreviation, number, title, pre and co reqs, and a difficulty parameter which we will use to weight the classes.
Compile using g++ -o main main.cpp, and execute using ./main.
You will see all of the course titles print to the screen, just to show the data has been read in and stored correctly.
