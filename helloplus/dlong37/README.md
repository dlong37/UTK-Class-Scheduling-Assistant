# Website Layout
> COSC340 Assignment 6 - David Long (dlong37)

## Description
This is a layout for a tech website. I followed a tutorial to hone in my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills. These skills will be necessary in creating an attractive and inviting space for users when generating their schedules.

## Running the Website
This was simply to test my abilities with creating a nice aesthetic for a website. The buttons will react whenever they are clicked on though, and you can navigate to the tech page in the navigation bar.
