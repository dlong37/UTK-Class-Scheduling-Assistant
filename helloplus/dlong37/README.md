# Website Layout
> COSC340 Assignment 6 - David Long (dlong37)

## Description
This is a layout for a tech website. I followed a tutorial to hone in my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills. This was simply to test my abilities with creating a nice aesthetic for a website. These skills will be necessary in creating an attractive and inviting space for users when generating their schedules.

## Running the Website
Navigate to index.html first. It is just a simple website design. The buttons will react whenever they are clicked on, and you can navigate to the tech page in the navigation bar. Certain pictures will enlarge when hovered over, and some buttons will have an animation effect when hovered over as well.
