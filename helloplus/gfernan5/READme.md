## Hello World Website
Assignment 6 - gfernan5

### Description
This is a simple website which has two pages; A Home page and a Hello! page which have pictures in them. The Home page is the main page launched by index.html and links to the Hello! page. The Hello! page is the page that holds the image that says Hello World! This makes the Hello World program a bit more interesting by making you click around for it. Since our app should run on the web, using HTML and CSS are very important so I chose to do this for this assignment.

### Running
Download index.html, hello.html, style.css and the images folder into a folder and double click on index.html to launch the webpage.

### Note
I will be learning Javascript for our COSC340 project but for the purposes of this assignment I did not include any Javascript because I have never made a webpage before so HTML and CSS felt like a great start for now.
